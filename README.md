📟 LcdSensorLed
A simple project that displays the distance between a sensor and the nearest object on an LCD. Additionally, LEDs light up at specific distance thresholds to provide visual feedback.

✨ Features
📏 Real-time distance measurement.

📺 Displays distance on an LCD screen.

💡 LEDs light up at:

25 cm

50 cm

75 cm

100 cm

Hardware Setup


LCD and LED Display


📦 Requirements
Ultrasonic distance sensor (e.g., HC-SR04)

16x2 LCD display

4 LEDs

Resistors

Arduino board

Jumper wires

Breadboard

🔧 How It Works
The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to the nearest object.

The distance is displayed on the LCD.

LEDs light up based on proximity to preset distance thresholds.

🧠 Use Case
Perfect for basic obstacle detection, visual feedback projects, or learning how to integrate sensors with displays and outputs like LEDs.
